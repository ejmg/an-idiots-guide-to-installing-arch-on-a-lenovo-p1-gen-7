* arch install dot text

*consider this guide WIP.*

*furthermore, use this guide at your own risk.*

these are my notes, thus far, for installing arch linux, from scratch,
on a Lenovo P1 Gen 7 w/ an Intel Ultra 9 185H, NVIDIA RTX 4070 Max-Q,
and 64Gb RAM.

The features of this install include:
- Dual Boot with windows and arch on separate SSDs
  - systemd-boot + edk2-shell for booting into Windows
- unencrypted =/boot= with the primary Arch partition encrypted with LUKS
- BTRFS for volume management + swapfile for proper system hibernation
- ZRAM based swap

** summary/review

my system works. it works fast. it work good. it work nice. it just
work. that was my experience the last time I installed arch and wrote
up notes on it for my old lenovo X1 (it still works and runs arch just
fine, btw).

i went into this not expecting the same experience because of
NVIDIA. this proved to be the case but, more than anything else, a lot
of things had changed since i last made a full system install from
scratch. furthermore, this time round, I am using tools like
systemd-boot, edk2-shell, and BTRFS. [[https://youtu.be/UW12BT9pYEw?feature=shared][the game done changed]].

** status of guide

this guide is basically 95% complete in terms of the following objectives:
- what did i need to do to get windows to play nicely with installing arch on the second SSD
  - this includes not just releasing the second drive from bitlocker/windows but also dual booting
  - the only caveat is dual booting without disabling bitlocker on the
    first SSD, on which there is a note in the post-install section
- what did i need to do to actually install arch itself on that ssd/this laptop
  - this includes setting up LUKS, BTRFS, and ZRAM
- what did i need to do to get a basic DE up and running
  - this includes loading into the system, decrypting it, and
    successfully logging into my desktop environment where Everything
    Just Works.
  - this also includes NVIDIA playing nicely


of these things, only the first section on windows that is sparse in
documentation. I did all of that before I started writing this file
and I only had to do it once... and I haven't gone back to document it
more fully. Sorry I haven't done that yet. FWIW, the outline of
headers is like 1/2 of the documentation because it really wasn't that
hard.

** references/resources
besides the arch wiki itself, one of the best resources in existence
for learning about linux etc, here are the guides that influenced my
own by way of showing me different approaches to (mostly) the same
subset of features and issues that this guide tackles.
- @Th3Whit3Wolf's [[https://gist.github.com/Th3Whit3Wolf/0150bd13f4b2667437c55b71bfb073e4][arch_sec_install.sh gist]]
  - this guide uses =refind= instead of =systemd-boot=
- Arch wiki user ZachHilman's [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:ZachHilman/Installation_-_Btrfs_%2B_LUKS2_%2B_Secure_Boot][personal guide]]
  - this guide builds a UKI with secure boot enabled
- @orhun's [[https://gist.github.com/orhun/02102b3af3acfdaf9a5a2164bea7c3d6][notes on his arch linux install]]
  - this guide uses ZFS instead of BTRFS and has secure boot with TPM enabled
  - I use a BTRFS managed swapfile, he uses a physical partition.
- The Rad Lectures YT video tutorial, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgg5oNDylG8][Arch Linux Install Guide (including BTRFS, QTile, ZRAM, disk encryption, timeshift)]]
  - He uses QTile, I'm not. I also use a swapfile in addition to ZRAM.
- mpr's YT video, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maIu1d2lAiI][Snapper Rollback on Arch Linux]]

As you can see, I noted key feature differences in these guides in
case you might be more interested in pursuing alternative install
features. If you do that, you should probably use that specific guide
instead of mine. I do have a strong interest in checking out UKIs and
secure-boot (a TODO further below) but I am content, for the time
being, with running with the install I have now. In theory, UKI should
be pretty trivial to change to (I nearly had it working previously and
suspect I know the error now) and my only hesistance with enabling
secure boot is the fact it can, in theory, brick your system. Many
users have no issue with this, new Lenovo laptops included, but I
am... holding out... for now... on the hopes someone else with a gen 7
P1 will take the leap first and confirm success re: enabling secure
boot with self-signed keys.

** preface note on installing with SSD upgrade
I bought a customized model.
- 2x1Tb SSDs
- 64Gb RAM
- NVIDIA RTX 4070 Max-Q
- Intel Ultra 9 185H


However, I upgraded the SSD slot that is ultimately used for Arch
Linux on this machine.

You read that correctly: I preserved my window install (more on that
below) by simply keeping the OSs on seperate drives. This works really
well for me because it means that the EFI partitions are cleanly
seperated and that, absent re-install shenanigans, Windows should
never mangle my linux drive and vice-versa.

*Even if you are not doing that*, the following is good information to
know.

*** drive labels

Before changing my drives, the "primary" SSD (where Windows is
installed) was reported as =nvme0n1=. I wrote this guide while testing
my install on the original "secondary" SSD. At the time, that second
drive was labeled =nvme1n1=.

After nailing out a ~fully functional and fleshed out base install of
Arch, I upgraded the second drive. When I first booted the system,
*the labels of my drives swapped*. However, when I rebooted the system
again... they were back to their original names. They haven't changed
since.

The only reason I mention this is as a warning to pay attention to
your drives. Don't blindly copy the labels I use in this guide. I
don't want you to accidentally nuke your windows partition, or
anything else, because you presumed that these labels are identical
across machines and installs.

*** mapping drives to physical drive slots 

The only other note I have is which physical drive slot is which. That
is to say—when the laptop is flipped over and opened up—of the two
physical SSD slots, the leftside slot is the drive that contains the
base windows install. The second slot, the one I installed arch linux
on and eventually upgraded, is the slot on the righthand side of the
laptop. For those wondering, the process was extremely easy given the
new design of lenovo laptops. Maybe this note might help someone save
the 5 minutes it would take to check & re-swap SSDs.

TODO: attach the photos of swapping SSDs.

** Windows & UEFI/bios
*** find EFI partition for windows
Go to disk management and confirm the partition setup. In particular,
if you plan on dual booting, now is a good time to learn where
Windows' EFI partition is.

For me:
- =Disk 0= is the partition that Windows itself is installed on
  + =Partition 1=, i.e. =nvme0n1p1=, is the EFI partition for Windows
  + it is =260mb= size
- you can also note the =2gb= recovery partition at the *end* of the drive
- the other drive is the second SSD and is currently entirely unused. this is where I am installing arch.
  + this is =nvme1n1= on my system
*** copy bitlocker backup codes
So my drives came encrypted with Bitlocker by
default... but... because I didn't pay for Windows 11 Pro... I only
have a nerfed version of bitlocker. I can't manage my encrypted drives
willy-nilly. Without upgrading to Windows 11 Pro, this has
implications in terms of managing encrypted drives.

Go to settings for encryption and click on the option for Bitlocker
backup codes. It should take you to a microsoft website that gives you
a code for each encrypted drive. Remember this URL & how to login into
the same account. You should also probably save a backup somewhere.
*** TODO disable bitlocker on the second SSD
Go back and document this correctly lol.

We need to disable Bitlocker on the second drive. If you don't have Windows 11 Pro like myself, that means:
1. Once you disable bitlocker, you can't reenable it on the drive. This really shouldn't be an issue.
2. We have to use a bespoke Windows Command to get this to work
**** windows command prompt & =manage-bde=
- nvme1n1 is the "free" SSD, i.e. doesn't have windows installed on this drive
- windows has this labeled as =D:=
- ojala we shall liberate it


Since I have Windows 11 *Home*, I don't have the full suite of
bitlocker tools that makes this a one or two click solution. Instead,
I had to dig around [[https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/turning-off-bitlocker-encryption-on-windows-11/e6403c0a-1f8a-46a4-af0a-d96a9dcced7a][for this]]. Make sure you use the proper elevated
command console, not the newer version that is used by default on
windows 11.

If you have Windows 11 *Home* like I do, know that this is not
reversible. You don't get to re-encrypt a drive without a Windows 11 Pro
license.

*** disable secure boot in windows settings
*NOTE* Remember when I said you need to have access to your bitlocker
backup codes? I meant it! After we disable secure boot, the drive that
still has Windows may get upset and ask for them the next time you try
to boot into it.

*** restart & disable secure boot

Restart the laptop. Press F1 as it boots up and you should be able to
get into the UEFI menu. Go under startup settings and there should be
an option for secure boot. You need to disable it for now.

*** restart windows & check if bitlocker is mad

This is just a sanity check. Make sure you can get back into your machine, basically. Your backup code should Just Work.
** setup liveusb & install environment
alright, with the windows stuff aside, let's move on to arch.
*** setup a live usb
I'm not going to help you here beyond giving the recommendation for
what I did this time. Fedora has a live usb writer that Just Works. I
don't know why I used this tool or even why/how I found it. I've
previously formatted drives with nothing but =dd= but the GUI provided
by Fedora was literally flawless for me across 3 brands of flashdrives
and across 4 different linux ISOs. This includes dealing with how
macOS specifically responds to a liveUSB. If you want to use =dd=, you
can look at my old guide but I don't advise that. There's better
resources out there.

Here's a link to the [[https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download][fedora media writer]]. They have a media writer for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. I did this with macOS so if it doesn't work
for you on e.g. Windows, I'm sorry.

You're going to want to grab an arch linux ISO, too, of course. You
can grab any that are listed on the [[https://archlinux.org/download/][arch linux website]]. If you're not
going to torrent one, just pick a mirror.

It never hurts to check the blake2b checksums + pgp signatures. the
arch linux download page includes instructions for this. It's not hard
and it's a good learning experience if, for some god forsaken reason,
you've never done either of these things while reading this specific
arch linux install guide. Godspeed. For what it is worth, I did, in
fact, do this myself for my own install.

*** boot the arch iso

plug in your liveUSB into the p1. turn on the p1. go to the bios setup
again like in our previous steps.  this time, however, go to
startup(?) option. click on boot. drag the option for your USB to the
top. I used a Samsung FIT USB and the options list basically had that
as the literal selection. I suspect that it will show your USB by
brand, as well.

save settings and start. you should be presented with a black screen
that gives you the options to choose the arch linux live
installer. press enter and proceed.

you should see a boot window for arch linux. congrats. you have just started.

*** config network

we want internet and =iwctl= is our tool. you can use something
simpler (as I did previously) but this is painless. choose painless
when possible, there's enough pain in this process as it stands.

#+begin_src sh
  iwctl
  [iwd]# station list # should give us a list of our connections and show wlan0 and that it is disconnected
  [iwd]# station wlan0 get-networks
  [iwd]# station wlan0 connect ${YOUR_NETWORK_HERE}
  [iwd]# station list # should now show us connected if done correct
  [iwd]# quit
#+end_src

you should test that your connection works with e.g. =ping google.com=. if packets are successfully shooting without drop, you are good to go.

*** ssh into liveusb

This is optional but I'm going to do it as it makes copying & pasting
commands easier and less error prone.
#+begin_src sh
  passwd
#+end_src

Simply provide a password.

Then, find your IP:
#+begin_src sh
  ip addr show # I am only giving partial results below. What matters is the wlan0 section:
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
<SNIP>  
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e8:bf:b8:3e:30:be brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.213/24 metric 600 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic wlan0 # THIS IS THE LINE.
<SNIP>
#+end_src

Take that IP address and ssh on your machine of choice. Previously, I've done this all locally on the machine I was formatting but, since I'm writing this document as I go alone, it really helps to just SSH in myself.
i.e.
#+begin_src sh
  ssh root@192.168.1.213
#+end_src

*** Keymapping

#+begin_src sh
  loadkeys us # run loadkeys list to find other keymappings if that is what you need
#+end_src

*** HiDPI console font

#+begin_src sh
  ls /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts # all fonts on liveusb
  setfont ter-132n # terminus normal font. only relevant if actually using machine, not ssh'ing etc. will set later again.
#+end_src

*** timedate
#+begin_src sh
  timedatectl set-timezone US/Central # Same thing with keys, just run timedatectl list-timezones to find your tz of choice.
  timedatectl set-ntp true
#+end_src

** partitioning drives
*** partitioning with =gdisk=

it's now time to perform our partitioning. as already stated in
previous sections, it is extremely important that you know the name of
the drives and which one you intend to install arch linux on. If you
are like me and plan on keeping the windows 11 install on one of the
two drives, it is pretty important that you don't accidentally nuke
the drive it is installed on. In the case of *my* machine:
- =nvme0n1= is the drive with base windows 11 install. *I do not want to format this drive*
- =nvme1n1= is the extra ssd that I previously removed bitlocker from. *I want to format this drive*.

with this knowledge in mind, let's start partioning =nvme1n1= with gdisk.

#+begin_src sh
  root@archiso ~ # gdisk /dev/nvme1n1

  gdisk /dev/nvme1n1
  GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.10

  Partition table scan:
    MBR: protective
    BSD: not present
    APM: not present
    GPT: present

  Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
  Command (? for help):
#+end_src

This will start the partitioning process. You can enter =?= to see a list of commands, etc.

Before moving on, it needs to be understood that I am about to nuke
the entire disk. If there is anything you need on this disk, you need
to immediately quit this guide and go back up your device.

With that said, what now follows is a step-by-step list of the
formatting commands I will use to format my drive. The result will be
a disk with two physical partitions. The first partition will be a 1Gb
EFI boot partition. The second will be the entire rest of the disk
space.

we want to format =nvme1n1= into two parts. here we go:
- =o=
  - overwrite disk
  - =Y=
  - =ENTER=
- =n=
  - new partition
  - =ENTER=
    - default partition 1
  - =ENTER=
    - default first sector
  - =+1G=
    - make it a gigabyte
  - =ef00=
    - make the partition EFI
- =n=
  - second partition
  - =ENTER=
    - default partition 2
  - =ENTER=
    - default start sector
  - =ENTER=
    - default to remainder of disk
  - =ENTER=
    - default Linux File System 
- =w=
  - write changes to disk
  - =Y=

*** encrypting with =LUKS=

encrypt the second partition

#+begin_src sh
  cryptsetup luksFormat --hash sha512 /dev/nvme1n1p2
#+end_src

this encrypts our main partition with the dafaults with only the added
modification of making the hash SHA512.

**** open container

#+begin_src sh
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1p2 main
#+end_src

*** backup LUKS header file

with a separate USB (formatted with a linux friendly file system), we
should go ahead and make a quick backup file of the LUKS header. If
the header were to ever get destroyed or corrupted, it would be
impossible to decrypt our partition. This is something that can occur
from 3rd party libraries that attempt to modify the file partition
with or without your knowledge. Given the risk, having a backup ready
is a smart idea.

Using =lsblk=, let's assume that the USB appears as =sdb= with a single =sdb1= partition:

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir /mnt/backup_usb
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backup_usb
  cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/nvme1n1p2 --header-backup-file /mnt/backup_usb/arch-LUKS-header-backup-file.img
  umount /mnt/backup_usb
#+end_src

*** format partitions 
**** main

#+begin_src sh
  # with mkfs.btrfs, -L is the flag for labels. DO NOT USE -n (nodesize).
  mkfs.btrfs -L main /dev/mapper/main
#+end_src

**** efi (=/boot=)

#+begin_src sh
  # ...but, for mkfs.fat, -n is used to give a name (label) to the partition...
  mkfs.fat -F32 -n EFI /dev/nvme1n1p1 
#+end_src

*** create btrfs subvolumes & mount

we are going to follow the arch wiki and create a flat hierarchy for
subvol management with BTRFS.

#+begin_src sh
  mount /dev/mapper/main /mnt
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@home
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@snapshots
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@log
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@pkg
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@tmp
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@docker
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@postgres
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@flatpak
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@swap
  btrfs sub create /mnt/@btrfs
  umount /mnt
#+end_src


what the volumes created above are for, in order:
- / (root)
- /home
- /.snapshots
- /var/log
- /var/cache/pacman/pkg
- /var/tmp
- /var/lib/docker
- /var/lib/postgres
- /var/lib/flatpak
- the root of the btrfs fs itself.
  - this is made explicit below when mounting. notice how btrfs's subvol is set to 5, the tacit/default root of btrfs itself.
  - this makes the entire btrfs fs available to us, explicitly, to see.
  - we don't want to use this as *our* root, however. that's a bad idea.
- the BTRFS managed swapfile (more on that below)


after creating those subvolumes, we unmount main because we're going
to remount these subvolumes with new options.

as a note: i will probably end up adding more volumes. an immediate
example would be for the type of files/data stored under
=~/.cache=. this is the type of data that I wouldn't want to be
included in system snapshots which is why, eventually, I will need to
handle those explicitly and separately from my =@home= subvol.


with that said, we re-mount the subvolumes to their specific directories.

#+begin_src sh
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@ /dev/mapper/main /mnt
  mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,.snapshots,var/log,var/cache/pacman/pkg,var/tmp,var/lib/docker,var/lib/postgres,var/lib/flatpak,btrfs,swap}
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@home /dev/mapper/main /mnt/home
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@snapshots /dev/mapper/main /mnt/.snapshots
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@log /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/log
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@pkg /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@tmp /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/tmp
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@docker /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/lib/docker
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@postgres /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/lib/postgres
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvol=@flatpak /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/lib/flatpak
  mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,commit=120,space_cache=v2,ssd,discard=async,autodefrag,subvolid=5 /dev/mapper/main /mnt/btrfs
  mount -o noatime,subvol=@swap /dev/mapper/main /mnt/swap
#+end_src


one final aside: all of these options are basically unnecessary. they are simply made explicit here for my own benefit.

furthermore, there is a limitation for how fstab works. when we later
generate it, you will notice that the mount for @swap will have the
same options as all the other mount points despite what we specified
above. that's a known limitation. it doesn't matter after what we are
about to do. i think. i'm pretty sure. really, is anyone confident
about anything? not me. anyway—

*** enable swapfile with btrfs

this swapfile will be used exclusively for hibernation only. zram will
be our actual swap device for swap.

i am setting it to 48gb for my machine.

you could see what linux will estimate your hibernation image size by looking at the following:

#+begin_src sh
  cat /sys/power/image_size
#+end_src

by default, this is made to be 2/5ths of system memory. my system has
64gb. the standard rules for allocating swap space say to alloc the
size of RAM + a lil more. those rules are mostly outdated. on the
not-too-crazy assumption i won't be hibernating while in the middle of
a workload that is consuming a majority of memory, 48gb is a
reasonable allocation for me.

why swapfile? why BTRFS? this saves me from having to make an
additional physical disk partition which, in turn, gives me the
ability to expand, shrink, or delete it later.

now we tell BTRFS to make the swapfile so it knows to not manage the
subvolume as if it will be used for making snapshots etc later.

#+begin_src sh
  # this is a one line for the manual mkswap commands but more is needed.
  btrfs filesystem mkswapfile --size 48g --uuid clear /mnt/swap/swapfile
  # now we explicitly setup the swapfile and ensure it has the correct
  # properties, for BTRFS and access permissions
  truncate -s 0 /mnt/swap/swapfile
  chattr +C /mnt/swap/swapfile
  fallocate -l 48G /mnt/swap/swapfile
  chmod 600 /mnt/swap/swapfile
  mkswap /mnt/swap/swapfile
#+end_src

finally, turn it on.

#+begin_src sh
  swapon /mnt/swap/swapfile
#+end_src

check in

#+begin_src sh
  swapon --show
#+end_src

you should see a swapfile now and it should have a low priority. this
is good because we only want to use this for hibernation, ie we don't
want this file to be used for anything else, non-hibernation swapping included.

*** mount ESP

originally tried =/efi= but there's several limitations to choosing
this directory such that, without falling back to using GRUB etc, it
does not work well with systemd-boot. i lost a solid day and a half
because of a cascade of misunderstandings that fell downstream from
this fact. you can setup a system on =/efi= instead of =/boot= but you
have been warned. read the arch wiki carefully when departing on this
path.

that aside, let's move on and mount our =/boot=

#+begin_src sh
  # want to ensure the correct read/write permissions are given to /boot
  mount -o uid=0,gid=0,fmask=0077,dmask=0077 /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/boot
#+end_src

** bootstrap arch
*** update mirrors

try to get better mirrors for bootstrapping

#+begin_src sh
reflector -c US,CA,IS --latest 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
#+end_src

*** pacstrap

i'm going to add nano as a default along with mg, an emacs-like editor.

since i'm ssh'ing for this install and i'm using kitty, =kitty-terminfo= ensures that terminal variables are set correctly
for e.g. editing files..

#+begin_src sh
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware mg nano kitty-terminfo
#+end_src

you may see a stray ="error: command failed to execute correctly"=. This is actually a warning, not a hard error. So long as the packages install successfully, everything is ok.

*** generate fstab

#+begin_src sh
genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab 
#+end_src

you can check the contents of fstab.

#+begin_src sh
  nano /mnt/etc/fstab
#+end_src

make sure that =/boot= has correct permissions while you are there.

here's an example of an =/boot= entry with *incorrect* permissions. 

#+begin_src conf
  # /dev/nvme1n1p1 LABEL=EFI
  #                                                        NOTE: fmask and dmask have incorrect permissions! Simply change them to 0077.
  UUID=7986-93D2          /boot            vfat            rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro   0 2
#+end_src

if you don't have these correct, =bootctl= will later complain about it.

in theory, you should be able to delete the entry for =/boot= entirely as =systemd-boot= is supposed to manage it automatically but I had no issues so... 🤷

moving on, it's important to also make sure that swap is configured correctly. is should look like this:
#+begin_src sh
  /swap/swapfile          none            swap            defaults        0 0
#+end_src

cool. moving on.

*** arch-chroot

#+begin_src sh
  arch-chroot /mnt
#+end_src

** configure arch install
*** enable multilib

edit =/etc/pacman.conf= by uncommenting the following lines:

#+begin_src conf
  # [multilib]
  # Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
#+end_src

make sure it is =[multilib]= and not =[multilib-testing]=.

sync pacman db

#+begin_src sh
  pacman -Sy
#+end_src
*** local time & locale

#+begin_src sh
  ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Central etc/localtime
  hwclock --systohc
  mg -n /etc/locale.gen # uncomment en_US.UTF-8
  locale-gen
  echo "LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" > /etc/locale.conf # Not the same thing as previous command & some applications need this. *shrug*
  echo "KEYMAP=us" > /etc/vconsole.conf # this makes our keyboard config permanent
  # Next command will not work if you don't end up installing terminus-font
  echo "FONT=ter-132n" >> /etc/vconsole.conf # make the previous HiDPI font config permanent, too.
#+end_src

*** hostname

#+begin_src sh
echo "HOST_NAME_OF_CHOICE" >> /etc/hostname
#+end_src

and then create a hostsfile:
#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /etc/hosts
#+end_src

and past the following:
#+begin_src conf
  127.0.0.1	localhost
  ::1		localhost
  127.0.1.1	HOSTNAME.localdomain	localhost
#+end_src

where =HOSTNAME= is the hostname you just echoed into =/etc/hostname=.
*** root user passwd

not the same as the root user we created in the live iso. this is the real deal this time.

#+begin_src sh
  passwd 
#+end_src

*** install some more packages

TODO: maybe breakout font shit and non-core system stuff further
below along with when we setup desktop stuff.

TODO: emphasize that downstream configs are made on the assumption
these packages have been installed. Several sections will simply not
work without them.

Note, I am *installing kernel modules for NVIDIA and intel's
microcode* (=intel-ucode=, =vulkan-intel=, =intel-media-driver=). If
you don't have NVIDIA or intel on your machine, you shouldn't be
installing these lol.

#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S linux-headers linux-lts linux-lts-headers os-prober dkms intel-ucode intel-media-driver vulkan-intel libva-utils vdpauinfo \
	 nvidia-open-dkms nvidia-utils nvidia-settings opencl-nvidia efivar edk2-shell efibootmgr sudo git pigz \
	 lbzip2 networkmanager iwd plymouth openssh zsh zsh-completions dosfstools gptfdisk btrfs-progs man-pages \
	 man-db terminus-font ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation noto-fonts ttf-fira-code cantarell-fonts adobe-source-sans-fonts \
	 adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-otc-fonts noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji libfido2  \
	 firefox chromium duf xwaylandvideobridge
#+end_src

there are a lot of fonts in here but this will provide you with a
system that should be able to render a large chunk of east/south Asian
character sets in addition to providing emojis, monospace fonts, and a
good selection of san-serif fonts.

*** create user

let's make a new user. let's make you. welcome home to this terrible prison of steel and silicon.

#+begin_src sh
  useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/zsh USERNAME
#+end_src

setup password

#+begin_src sh
  passwd USERNAME
#+end_src

enable wheel group to have sudo priveledges 

#+begin_src sh
  EDITOR=nano visudo # or just visudo if you're comfortable with vi
#+end_src

find the following lines:
#+begin_src conf
  ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
  # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
#+end_src

and uncomment the second line:
#+begin_src conf
  ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
  %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL # this line. the second line. right here.
#+end_src

go ahead and test your user. if you installed zsh like i did above,
you'll get hit with the new user prompt. you can walk through it (it's
pretty short and straightforward) or just skip. if you want to do it
later, it will tell you how to do that, too.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo -iu USERNAME # this will probably throw an "unable to find terminal name for device..." error, that's expected here.
  archiso% sudo pacman -Sy # this should prompt for your user's password. if everything is alright, you'll successfully sync pacman's packages.
  archiso% exit # you could do the rest of this guide as your user. you just need to start using sudo, of course.
#+end_src

*** update mkinitcpio

#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
#+end_src

add nvidia modules and btrfs.

#+begin_src conf
  MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm btrfs)
#+end_src

as an aside, I'm fairly sure that btrfs is not necessary here as a module. sorry, this is what you get when you use someone else's guide. the arch mods were right :)

moving on, update our HOOKS to use systemd, microcode, and the correct encryption module.
#+begin_src conf
  HOOKS=(base systemd keyboard autodetect microcode modconf sd-vconsole block filesystems sd-encrypt fsck)
#+end_src

At this point, I need to warn that =kms= should not be in the above
stanza. NVIDIA handles its own kms. Using the =kms= module risks
enabling =nouveau= which would conflict with nvidia.

the =systemd= hook provides a lot of services for us that otherwise
require several more hooks when using =busybox=. this includes support
for =hibernation=.

*** regenerate initramfs

#+begin_src sh
  mkinitcpio -p linux
  mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
#+end_src

be mindful to specifically note a log message for =Early uncompressed CPIO image generation successful=.
This tells us that our =microcode= hook is working correctly.

** setup bootloader
*** bootctl install

#+begin_src sh
  bootctl install
#+end_src

if everything goes to plan, we should now have a =/boot= directory
with a basic UEFI boot manager copied over for us along with a basic
UEFI boot entry for "Linux Boot Manager".

if things don't go right, or if you have issues later with boot
options, checkout what =bootctl list= reports. it will tell you when
it sees entries and when something is wrong with them.

*** loader conf

pretty simple. we need to tell the bootloader how to boot our images of arch linux.

first we set the defaults

#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /boot/loader/loader.conf
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf
  default arch.conf
  timeout 5
  editor no
  console-mode auto
#+end_src

*** entries confs

now we add the boot entries. before we do that, however, let's grab
the offset for our swapfile partition that is handled by btrfs:

#+begin_src sh
  btrfs inspect-internal map-swapfile -r /swap/swapfile
#+end_src

you'll get a number. keep ahold of that number. we're going to  use that in our arch.conf below for our =resume_offset= kernel parameter.

finally, grab the UUID for the LUKS partition:

#+begin_src sh
  blkid | grep nvme1n1p2
#+end_src
You should get a UUID in the general form of =xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx=. you're going to need that.

now create the arch.conf

#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
#+end_src

copy and past the following entry. Note that you must replace the values
- =UUID=
- =NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME=
- =NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME_WITH_SWAPFILE=
- =BTRFS_OFFSET=

In our case, =NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME= and =NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME_WITH_SWAPFILE= are the same thing, =main=, because we're using a swapfile provisioned by BTRFS.

=BTRFS_OFFSET= and =UUID= are the values we just obtained above, substitute those accordingly as well.

once again, I must emphasize that I am setting up my laptop to use
NVIDIA graphics with Intel. This influences the choice of kernel
parameters used below. You are going to need different parameters if
your hardware is different. It is as shrimple as that 🦐.

#+begin_src conf
  title Arch Linux
  linux /vmlinuz-linux
  initrd /initramfs-linux.img
  options rd.luks.name=UUID=NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME root=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME rootflags=subvol=@ resume=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME_WITH_SWAPFILE resume_offset=BTRFS_OFFSET nvidia-drm.modeset=1 NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 nvidia.NVreg_TemporaryFilePath=/var/tmp sysrq_always_enabled=1 nowatchdog splash quiet loglevel=3 systemd.show_status=auto rd.udev.log_level=3 vt.global_cursor_default=0 rw
#+end_src

with the above config, we should have a fairly silent (not a wall of text) boot that ensures hibernation works, including all of NVIDIA's graphic memory.

*TODO* enumerate kernel options explicitly with notes on what they do
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Silent_boot
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#DRM_kernel_mode_setting

make a copy of it for linux-lts

#+begin_src sh
  cp /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf /boot/loader/entries/arch-lts.conf
#+end_src

and just change the =linux= and =initrd= lines to their lts versions

#+begin_src conf
  title Arch Linux LTS
  linux /vmlinuz-linux-lts
  initrd /initramfs-linux-lts.img
  options rd.luks.name=UUID=NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME root=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME rootflags=subvol=@ resume=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME_WITH_SWAPFILE resume_offset=BTRFS_OFFSET nvidia-drm.modeset=1 NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 nvidia.NVreg_TemporaryFilePath=/var/tmp sysrq_always_enabled=1 nowatchdog splash quiet loglevel=3 systemd.show_status=auto rd.udev.log_level=3 vt.global_cursor_default=0 rw
#+end_src

we can also add another one for the fallback initramfs for each
version of linux. these confs only differ by their =initrd= file
because the purpose of a fallback is to provide a (hopefully)
functional fallback initramfs for that given version of linux.

#+begin_src sh
  cp /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf /boot/loader/entries/arch-fallback.conf
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  title Arch Linux Fallback
  linux /vmlinuz-linux
  initrd /initramfs-linux-fallback.img
  options rd.luks.name=UUID=NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME root=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME rootflags=subvol=@ resume=/dev/mapper/NAME_OF_LUKS_VOLUME_WITH_SWAPFILE resume_offset=BTRFS_OFFSET nvidia-drm.modeset=1 NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 nvidia.NVreg_TemporaryFilePath=/var/tmp sysrq_always_enabled=1 nowatchdog splash quiet loglevel=3 systemd.show_status=auto rd.udev.log_level=3 vt.global_cursor_default=0 rw
#+end_src

note how line #2 is identical to the original. it's only =/initramfs-linux-fallback.img= that is different.

you can do this again for the lts version, too.

*** plymouth config

this is entirely optional but =plymouth= provides an alternative boot
screen that looks a smidge nicer than what you'll otherwise get when
presented with LUKS decryption prompt.

First, add =plymouth= to =HOOKS= in =mkinitcpio.conf=. It is critical
that you place it *before* =sd-encrypt= but *after*  =systemd=.

#+begin_src conf
  #                   V here V
  HOOKS=(base systemd plymouth keyboard autodetect microcode modconf sd-vconsole block filesystems sd-encrypt fsck)
#+end_src

if you are using plymouth, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you did the above edit.

Now make a config:

#+begin_src sh
  nano /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
#+end_src

I'm choosing the =solar= boot screen. it boots a blue solar flare screen. it is simple but works. we can add something cooler later (see below)

#+begin_src conf
  [Daemon]
  Theme=solar
  DeviceScale=1
#+end_src

let's rebuild our kernels again

#+begin_src sh
  mkinitcpio -p linux
  mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
#+end_src

Note: you could use the plymouth cli command instead of the above. it
works well but the above conf file is a good self-note for scaling the
display in case that is needed in the future.

regardless, you can use the cli tool to get a list of plymouth themes that are shipped by default:
#+begin_src sh
  plymouth-set-default-theme --list
#+end_src

and to set it:
#+begin_src sh
  plymouth-set-default-theme -R solar
#+end_src

when does this way, you'll note that our =initramfs= is automatically rebuilt for us.

*** networkmanager

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl enable NetworkManager
#+end_src

*** optimize makepkg

- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg#Compression


there's a lot of other optimizations but they're much more
questionable and are probably best configured on package-specific
basis if they were justified.

however, improving compression is an easy and clear win. this assumes
you installed all of the compression packages from the package install
provided earlier. 

open the conf file:

#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /etc/makepkg.conf
#+end_src

and comment out the defaults for the following entries.

#+begin_src conf
  COMPRESSZST=(zstd -c -T0 --auto-threads=logical -)
  COMPRESSGZ=(pigz -c -f -n)
  COMPRESSBZ2=(lbzip2 -c -f)
  # if aur helper installed, could go even further by installing plzip
  # COMPRESSLZ=(plzip -c -f)
#+end_src

TODO: leveraging tmpfs by default is a solid config optimization

*** enable ssh

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl enable sshd
#+end_src
*** enable bluetooth

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl enable bluetooth
#+end_src
*** fstrim

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl enable fstrim.timer
#+end_src
*** setup nvidia hibernation services

some of these ought to be handled by default given the DE of choice but you should go ahead and do this yourself:

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl enable nvidia-suspend
  systemctl enable nvidia-hibernate
  systemctl enable nvidia-resume
#+end_src

*** audio
- https://github.com/mikeroyal/PipeWire-Guide#Installing-PipeWire-on-Arch-Linux

install the following:

#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S pipewire wireplumber pipewire-alsa alsa-utils sof-firmware alsa-firmware
#+end_src

and then enable the following *user* services:

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl --user enable pipewire.socket
  systemctl --user enable pipewire-pulse.socket
  systemctl --user enable wireplumber
#+end_src

KDE should handle the rest elegantly when you reboot into the system
(more on that below). If that doesn't turn out to be the case, come
back to this section and try checking the =status= for each of these
services.

** install a DE ig
*** SDDM

this is our login manager. if you're using gnome, you'll need =GDM= instead. I don't recommend mixing and matching my configs with that.

#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S sddm && systemctl enable sddm
#+end_src

*** KDE

I used KDE last time I installed arch and it was the best desktop
experience of my life. I am not even joking. It Just Worked for
everything I cared about and was less buggy/clunky than Gnome which I
had used for years with Ubunto. This remains the case as I type this
on KDE Plasma 6.

This time, however, my install will be a smidge more slim. Instead of
installing large meta packages for KDE applications (no insult
implied, btw!), I'm installing =plasma= + applications that I know I
will want from the get-go. I will definitely be installing more as I
go along and realize I am missing something lol.

#+begin_src sh
    sudo pacman -S plasma konsole dolphin ark kwrite spectacle krunner partitionmanager kdeconnect gwenview okular kcharselect \
	 qt6-tools nuspell hunspell hunspell-en_us hunspell-es_mx libreoffice-fresh libmythes mythes-en hyphen hyphen-en
#+end_src

you're going to be given a lot of options. i went with defaults (don't
choose a number, just press =ENTER=) with the *exception of audio*
where i chose =pipewire-jack=, which uses =pipewire=, a forward
looking library for audio on linux. *you should do this too if you're
following my guide*.

*** sysreq
the kernel is already configured to use this from the mkinitcpio.conf
section and no further action is required. this is just a section
acknowledging it. =SysRq= is typically the print screen button. read
about it [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_shortcuts#Kernel_(SysRq)][here]].


this is just something useful to remember for when/if the system ever
becomes unresponsive beyond save. in theory, you should still be able
to kill it with these keystrokes.


At minimum, good shortcuts to remember:
- =Alt+SysRq+b= (Alt+PrintScreen b) will reboot a system.
- =Alt+SysRq+e= will send SIGTERM to *all* processes to terminate gracefully
- =Alt+SysRq+i= will SIGKILL *all* processes, forcing immediate termination


Notes and exceptions to keep in mind:
- On laptops that use Fn key to differentiate SysRq from PrintScreen,
  it may not actually be necessary to use the Fn key (i.e.,
  Alt+PrintScreen+letter could work).
- On Lenovo laptops (outside of their Legion lineup) SysRq is often
  configured as Fn+S. To use it press and hold Alt then press Fn+s,
  release Fn and s still holding Alt followed by the keys above.
- sometimes you need to use the right-side Alt, not the
  leftside. Apparently this can only be expected of the reboot sequence lol.

** restart and login

#+begin_src sh
  exit
  reboot
#+end_src

here's hoping.

make sure to take your liveUSB out of the machine before it finishes
rebooting or else you'll just reboot into the archISO. if you don't
see the boot entry screen for arch, reboot into the UEFI menu and make
sure that the linux bootloader option is at the top (above windows,
etc).

if that doesn't fix things... time to start reading the arch wiki 😎.

* Post-install configurations
If you have followed this far, congrats and apologies. You should have
a working KDE Desktop Environment that you can login into. What you do
hereout is mostly up to you. That said: *you should get ZRAM and an
AUR helper setup at the minimum.*

You already have a BTRFS swap partition setup for hibernation but no
actual Swap. ZRAM is a fast swap solution that is kept entirely in
memory and will help when your system is under high demand for memory.

An AUR helper is a non-critical but extremely useful tool. AUR is a
reason why a lot of people use arch in the first place.


Getting these two things up and going will be quick if you follow what
I document below in the two immediate subsections. Throw everything
else out the window for all I care.
** setup zram
*** config

#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S zram-generator
  nano /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf
  [zram0]
  zram-size = ram / 4 # 64gb => 16gb of ZRAM
  compression-algorithm = zstd
#+end_src

let's optimize it

#+begin_src sh
  nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-vm-zram-parameters.conf
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf
  vm.swappiness = 180
  vm.watermark_boost_factor = 0
  vm.watermark_scale_factor = 125
  vm.page-cluster = 0
#+end_src

*** enable
can't do this in chroot
#+begin_src sh
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service
  # make sure zram is goin
  zramctl
  # check and see what's going on
  swapon
#+end_src
** aur helper
yay is older, well established. paru is a bit newer. idc, really.
*** paru-bin
we're going to install the paru-bin version because this avoids pulling in rust as a system managed dependency.

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.cache/paru
  cd ~/.cache/paru
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
  cd paru-bin
  makepkg -si
#+end_src

you should now have =paru= on your path; if not, try opening a new shell.

once you have paru on your system, you can delete the directory we just made.
#+begin_src sh
    rm -rf ~/.cache/paru/paru-bin
    # update everything
    paru
    # "reinstall" paru-bin, even.
    # this just re-installs the AUR build artifacts under Paru's default config folder, ~/.cache/paru/clone
    paru -S paru-bin
#+end_src

you can use paru to handle everything else from here.

** dual boot windows using systemd-boot via edk2-shell
*** a preface
when I first did this, I had no issues with bitlocker and launching from the Arch managed bootloader.

however, upon re-install on my new SSD, bitlocker did nothing but give
me issues. As a result, I was forced between choosing an encrypted
windows partition and using a single bootloader to launch. For now, I
have decrypted the windows partition for the sake of ease-of-use but I
plan on trying to re-encrypt it later and see if that fixes the
problem (decrypting & then re-encrypting). I doubt it will, but I'll try lol.

*** configuring with edk2

- tutorial: https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/tutorial-add-a-systemd-boot-loader-menu-entry-for-a-windows-installation-using-a-separate-esp-partition/37431
  
cp edk2-shell into =/boot/=, systemd-boot will automatically detect it and add it to the boot options.
#+begin_src sh
  cp /usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi /boot/shellx64.efi
#+end_src
recall the windows partition with window's EFI, nvme0n1p1

check blkid for the PARTUUID of that partition:
#+begin_src sh
  blkid
  # something like this
  /dev/nvme0n1p1: LABEL="SYSTEM" UUID="7C1C-4DAE" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTLABEL="EFI system partition" PARTUUID="e0549dce-0997-4db7-ba2f-d3f1df67ade7"
#+end_src

mine was =0549dce-0997-[SNIP]-d3f1df67ade7=.

restart machine. choose the UEFI shell option. it should automatically
list the device mappings. look for the device alias that has the same
PARTUUID.

mine was =FS1:HD1b;BLK7=. You can theoretically go with any of these
three, =FS1=, =HD1b=, and =BLK7=, but IME the latter two are liable to
change (and thus break the boot entry) whereas =FS1= hasn't changed
across the several times I've had to play with this.

run =exit= and reboot into liveusb/arch and create the following file:

#+begin_src sh
  nano /boot/loader/entries/windows.nsh
#+end_src

with the full EFI path:
#+begin_src conf
  <ALIAS>:EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi
#+end_src

where =<ALIAS>= is the alias of your specific windows EFI (=FSX=,
=HDXY=, =BLKX=). As previously mentioned, I chose to go with =FS1=:
#+begin_src conf
  FS1:EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi	  
#+end_src

now just make the boot entry for windows at =/boot/entries/windows.conf=:
#+begin_src conf
  title Windows
  efi   /shellx64.efi
  options -nointerrupt -exit windows.nsh
#+end_src

some additional options:
#+begin_src sh
  # optional, hides default UEFI shell greeting
  -nomap -noversion
  # hide addition unnecessary output from UEFI
  -noconsoleout
#+end_src

aside: instead of using a =windows.nsh= file, you can just inline the
path in the following conf file. Just replace =windows.nsh= 1:1 with the full path enumerated above.

reboot and you should see windows in the boot menu! You should test it out. If it doesn't work, it may be related to the same issue I had above when using aliases *other than* the =FSX= variant.

** compose key
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key][The Compose Key]] is a pattern used for enabling character input on
keyboards that otherwise lack keys/support for things like diacritics,
special symbols used in alternative/non-ASCII alphabets, and so on.

Linux has long supported this by way of X11/Xorg and, to my knowledge,
this is how it is still handled, even in wayland environments. [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Configuring_compose_key][Here's
the Arch Wiki subsection on it]] along with where the default input
codes are sourced and how to modify them, etc.

For now, we'll just use [[https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/ComposeKey][KDE's approach to handling this]].

Go under keyboard settings via the searchbar. =Super=, ie the
Windows Key, should trigger this.

You should see three tabs: Hardware, Layouts, and Key Bindings.

For basic compose key functionality, go straight to Key Bindings and
enable "Configure keyboard options".

In the long list of options immediately below that, find "Position of
Compose Key" and expand its options. Here, you can choose how the
compose key works. For me, the rightside Alt key is good enough for me
since I'm working with a "70%" keyboard. You can obviously make your
system a bit more nuanced by using a second or layer to help trigger
the compose key which, IIRC, is what I did last time. I might do that
later. It's really your call to make.

Aside: this has small implications for editors and software that make
strong use of keybindings such as Emacs/VIM. FWIW, I have yet to hit a
situation where there wasn't an easy and good solution for when this
happens.
** IDEs
*** emacs
a lot of people don't know this, but GTK/QT apps can have less latency
than their terminal equivalent, emacs included!

this version is compiled with the gccjit flag *and* uses a pure gtk3
UI which provides performance improvements.
#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -S emacs-wayland
#+end_src

i have a lot of other stuff i want to do with my emacs so I'll leave it at that for now.

*** vscode

it's nice to have another, much more popular, editor on my system,
especially for collaboration and copying dev tooling/code environments
for contributions, etc.

let's install =vscodium= and some hooks that provide more of the
expected functionality of vscode (but without microsoft):

#+begin_src sh
  paru -S vscodium-bin vscodium-bin-marketplace vscodium-bin-features
#+end_src

this gets us the binary for vscodium + adds two sets of patches that
provide access to the extension marketplace + enables additional
features that are disabled by default.

IME, for whatever reason, the first time I ran =VSCodium - Wayland=
(the desktop shortcut produced by =vscodium-bin= for Wayland systems),
it caused a spike in CPU and didn't originally render the
window. I don't know why this happened but right clicking the app icon
and moving it to a different monitor made it visible/render
correctly. The behavior did not replicate the few times I re-opened it
afterwards, thankfully.

** js
*** nvm
install nvm
#+begin_src sh
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  nvm install node && nvm use node
#+end_src
*** install pnpm
since we now have node installed, it's pretty easy:
#+begin_src sh
  corepack enable pnpm && pnpm setup && source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src
*** install ts
#+begin_src sh
  pnpm install typescript --global
#+end_src
*** install turbo
#+begin_src sh
  pnpm install turbo --global
#+end_src
** python (pyenv & pyenv-virtualenv)
first install the required deps for python-build:
#+begin_src sh
  # All of these should be installed, sans tk
  paru -S openssl zlib xz tk
#+end_src

and then install pyenv itself:

#+begin_src sh
  curl https://pyenv.run | bash  
#+end_src

you're going to get some snippets to configure zsh for pyenv, go ahead and add them:
#+begin_src sh
  echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc                                                                                             0>--<20:47[367]
  echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

this should automatically install =pyenv-virtualenv= by default, go ahead and theck this real quick:

#+begin_src sh
  pyenv virtualenv --help
#+end_src

if you get help text, then =pyenv-virtualenv= is installed. if not, run the following:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
  echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
  exec "$SHELL"
#+end_src

finally, add a pyenv managed version of python. a good reason to do
this is so you always have a version of python that is separate from
the system python managed by arch. you could always do this yourself
by managing =venvs= but pyenv makes this whole workflow a lot easier,
both for things you might want installed at a "global" level and by
project, etc.

#+begin_src sh
  # this will take a minute or two
  pyenv install 3.12.6
  # or just name it 'g', like i do
  pyenv virtualenv 3.12.6 global
  # make it default
  pyenv global g
  # check your defaul
  pyenv global # or pyenv version
#+end_src
** ssh
*** import ssh
so i want to re-use a private key. first:
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.ssh
#+end_src

assuming I have it on a USB & it's mounted:
#+begin_src sh
  cp /run/media/<USER>/<USB>/id_ed25519* ~/.ssh
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#+end_src
*** ssh-agent
i would like my key to be handled across all terminals but i'm cool
not using an auto-login mechanism via KDE (or some other tool).

#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -S keychain
#+end_src

and then in my =.zshrc=:
#+begin_src zsh
  # add key names as necessary
  eval $(keychain --eval --quiet --agents ssh id_ed25519)
#+end_src

and then in my terminal:
#+begin_src sh
  source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

you should be prompted for the key's password.

i like to use github to test my ssh:
#+begin_src sh
  ssh -T git@github.com
#+end_src

you should get a congratulations message if everything is setup correctly.

** rust
just use the install script:
#+begin_src sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#+end_src

** additional plymouth themes

after successfully booting once with one of the pre-packaged plymouth themes, you can add some spice via the =plymouth-themes= repo.
- https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes


please note that *I had some initial issues* when using themes from
this repository but this was when I tried to pre-emptively install a
custom theme *before* booting and unlocking my KDE configured system
for the first time.

finally, beware of decrypt password issue & solution: https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes/issues/43#issuecomment-2212544121
  - in theory, this *should not* be an issue for us. =cantarell-fonts= and =ttf-dejavu= are installed and should be used.

ones I really like:
- Cross Hud, #17 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-cross-hud-git
- Hud 3, #44 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-hud-3-git (close second)
- Rings, #62 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-rings-git
- Seal 2, #67 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-seal-2-git (i think favorite)
- Square Hud, #75 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-square-hud-git
- Target 2, #77 in repo, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-target-2-git (close second)


installing & using themes is straightforward from the README:
#+begin_src
  git clone https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes.git
  cd plymouth-themes

  # copy into plymouth theme directory
  sudo cp -r angular /usr/share/plymouth/themes/

  # check if theme exist in dir, it should be shown in the list
  sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -l

  # now set the theme (angular, in this case) and rebuilt the initrd
  sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R angular
#+end_src

**** advice on testing

IMO, you might want to leave your =lts= image untouched from
plymouth. Why? this gives you a system you can cleanly boot into on
the off-chance a new plymouth theme doesn't work. This saves you the
trouble of having to use a recovery USB etc to get back into the
system and change/disable plymouth.

In other words, modify =/boot/loader/entries/linux-lts.conf= and add =plymouth.enable=0 disablehooks=plymouth= to the kernel parameters.

**** smooth transition

*I personally didn't see the need for this*. You are free to use it, however.

Create the following service:

#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service.d/plymouth.conf
#+end_src

with the following:

#+begin_src conf
  [Unit]
  Conflicts=plymouth-quit.service
  After=plymouth-quit.service rc-local.service plymouth-start.service systemd-user-sessions.service
  OnFailure=plymouth-quit.service

  [Service]
  ExecStartPost=-/usr/bin/sleep 30
  ExecStartPost=-/usr/bin/plymouth quit --retain-splash
#+end_src

** check screensharing on wayland
wayland is now the default on the majority of mainline linux
distros. a lot of work has been put into back-compatibilities for xorg
functionality that remains unsupported for whatever reason, be it the
available API or the literal architectural differences between xorg
and wayland.

that all said, if you are using KDE as I installed it
above... screensharing, at least via tools like chromium and discord,
ought to work.

to test chromium, you can go to this [[https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html][website]]. simply choose a screen,
an application, or a desktop and see if this page correctly mirrors
the selected target. if it doesn't work, something is definitely wrong
and you should start hitting up the arch wiki. =xdg-desktop-portal=
makes this possible for =gtk=, =kde=, and other backends, so that may
be a good place to start looking.

** more system audio
*** controlling cli audio with bluetooth headphones
in my case, this is necessary for controlling =ncspot= (see next
section) with my bluetooth headphones. this is not the only thing it
is useful for but it's pretty damn convenient just for =ncspot=.

simply install =playerctl=
#+begin_src sh
  paru -S playerctl
#+end_src

and then configure and enable the daemon as a systemd unit:
#+begin_src sh
  mg -n ~/.config/systemd/user/playerctld.service
#+end_src

with the following: 
#+begin_src conf
  [Unit]
  Description=Keep track of media player activity

  [Service]
  Type=oneshot
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/playerctld daemon

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl --user enable playerctld.service
#+end_src

*** ncspot
the simplest and imo most functional spotify client with a tiny memory
footprint.

there is currently an upstream bug that makes the AUR bin
non-functional but a fix has been deployed on main so let's install
that somewhere. note that the =covers= feature was causing a new,
possibly related, bug that made =ncspot= unuseable so we don't build
it with that feature.

#+begin_src sh
    mkdir sftw && cd sftw
    git clone git@github.com:hrkfdn/ncspot.git && cd ncspot
    # mpris, notify, share_clipboard, and pulseaudio_backend (this works with pipewire)
    # are included in default. 
    cargo build --release
#+end_src

i like to keep locally built binaries (non-AUR, etc) in my own =~/bin/= directory:
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir ~/bin && cp target/release/ncspot ~/bin
#+end_src

running =ncspot= will prompt you to follow an OATH link to connect
your account. after doing that, you should be able to use
=ncspot=. note, it might take a few seconds to populate the client as
it syncs your accounts state locally (playlists, recently favorited
songs, etc).

**** configuration

there's a lot to configure. [[https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/blob/main/doc/users.md#configuration][check it out here]].

**** TODO notifications

TODO: they don't seem to be spawning and should be enabled by
default. might just be an issue between what KDE is expecting and what
ncspot emits. not the biggest deal. 

**** kitty terminal 

with =kitty= terminal, ncspot used to struggle with some
ascii/coloring. *this doesn't appear to be the case anymore* but if
the problem returns, there's a trivial solution:

#+begin_src sh
  TERM=xterm-256color ncspot
#+end_src

simply create an alias in your =.zshrc= if this becomes something you
need.

*** EasyEffects (equalizer)
convenient audio equalizer with GUI built on GTK. Easy to use and with plenty of community contribs, so that's just what I went with.

this installs easyeffects + other deps that, on my machine, weren't
already pulled in by the other audio related packages I've installed
while working through this guide.
#+begin_src sh
  paru -S easyeffects lsp-plugins calf zam-plugins mda.lv2
#+end_src

furthermore, you would benefit from pulling in some profiles made by
the community. these are two big ones with decent presets that are
ready to use. download each repo's zip file, unzip it, and then copy
the json configs under =.config/easyeffects/output=:
- https://github.com/JackHack96/EasyEffects-Presets
- https://github.com/p-chan5/EasyPulse?tab=readme-ov-file

**** further audio nerd stuff to check out later
- https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq
*** noise suppression
EasyEffects also handles microphone noise suppression. I haven't had
to test this yet given discord rolls its own solution and that's the
only mic-related activity i've engaged in thus-far.

To do this, we'll use [[https://gist.github.com/jtrv/47542c8be6345951802eebcf9dc7da31][this profile]]. This profile was developed to
target masculine, ie lower pitched, voices. Based on my reading of the
config file (both the original and the current version), to make the
profile friender to higher pitched voices, modify the following lines
to a higher frequency:
#+begin_src js
  // This file is supposed to be JSON so these comments will be invalid if used in your config.
  {
    "input": {
      // Skipping lines...
      "equalizer#0": {
	// skipping...
	"left": {
	  "band0": {
	    "frequency": 50.0 // this is the line. increase this by e.g. 10-30 and see if it helps.
	    // SNIP
	  },
	  "band1": {
	    "frequency": 90.0 // same thing here. increase it by the same bump you did above.
	  },
	  // SNIP
	},
	// SNIP
	"right": {
	    // exact same thing as above for both band0 and band1 again.
	},
      },
    },
  }
#+end_src

while i doubt that these modifications are sufficient for a higher
pitched, more feminine voice, I think it will help by raising the core
frequency baseline used for monitoring human voice input. what is
really cool about this config is that it is AI generated so I have no
real way to introspect the logic that emitted it. /what a time to be alive/

**** alternatives to easyeffects for noise suppression
there are two popular/common solutions, one is packaged by arch
directly and the other is via aur. Including EasyEffects, each use
RNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks for audio noise reduction.
1. https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=noise-suppression-for-voice
   - this is the arch packaged solution
   - config: https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice#pipewire
   - considered slightly more complex to configure but, by that measure, allows more user customization
2. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/noisetorch
   - this is considered a lot more easy/user friendly in terms of defaults
   - also includes a threshold mechanism that auto-mute microphone
     when no speech is detected
     
** font tweaking
*** emojis still not rendering correctly on some applications/websites (?)
based on the way fontconfig works (this is cursed and eldritch
knowledge), it looks like we still need to explicitly demand for =Noto
Color Emoji= to be rendered across font families and when
e.g. websites request a specific type of emoji font that are not
available on our system (i.e. Apple Emoji, etc).

create the following:
#+begin_src sh
  mg -n /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/75-noto-color-emoji.conf

run =fc-cache -f=. restarting your session (logout & login) probably
wouldn't hurt, either, but I don't know the full nuances of how fonts
are cached and loaded by the desktop environment.

*if fonts break, this is the first thing that should be removed.*

*** certain emojis not rendering

i came to notice this with the transgender/trans flag.

KDE apps and some other things (chromium, oddly enough?) will not
render the e.g. trans flag correctly. Inputting it (via text fields,
etc) will show it rendering correctly, however. it appears this is
related, at minimum, years old bug with QT and its font
modernization. womp womp.

- https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/74736
- https://www.mail-archive.com/kde-bugs-dist@kde.org/msg608563.html
- https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-111801

*** fix =fractional_scaling=
In my short amount of time using KDE Plasma 6, there has been one
noticeable degradation from my prior usage. Fonts look /off/. It turns
out there's a small bug betweet QT and Plasma that causes fonts
rendered in some (QT) applications to look squished, particularly on
HDPi monitors with scaling.

This is the recommended mitigation for now. In theory, this should be
fixed very soon in Plasma/KDE as QT [[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479891#c48][has already shipped a fix in =qt6 6.8=]].

Create and open the following file:
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/
  mg -n ~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/path.sh
#+end_src

and add the following:
#+begin_src sh
  export QT_SCALE_FACTOR_ROUNDING_POLICY=RoundPreferFloor
#+end_src

This directory is special and any scripts inside of it are picked up
and ran by Plasma when the DE is initialized. [[https://userbase.kde.org/Session_Environment_Variables][Documentation]].

Add it to your =.zshrc= if you find yourself launching GUI applications
from the CLI directly and you noticed weird font compression.

** TODO secure sudo
*** root logins
** TODO finger print for sudo/login 
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fprint


going by the list of known devices with support, we can see that my
Lenovo P1 G7 has a compatible device with the following command:
#+begin_src sh
  # 27c6:6594 == Goodix MOC Fingerprint Sensor
  lsusb | grep "27c6:6594"
#+end_src

using fprintd has implications. a big one is that =S3= style Suspend
to RAM cannot be used. However, without changing UEFI settings, the
system is defaulted to =s2idle=, which is compatible with =fprintd=.

I'm not sure I want to use it, yet.

given that it is supported, lets install the following:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -S fprintd
#+end_src

*** enable sudo with fprint
first, open =/etc/pam.d/sudo= and add the following line to the top of the file:
#+begin_src conf

turns out my device is set to s2idle by default. running:

suspending entirely to RAM, the system will still intermittantly "wake
up" and check wifi, etc.

This is *inferior* to true Suspend to RAM, ie S3.

changing this would be a major gain to power saving when not connected
to a power source...

however, switching to s3 would mean =fprintd= is not usable (assuming I want to use it).

  - users also reporting success with lenovo p1 gen 6 (https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/10pq74e/my_easy_method_for_setting_up_secure_boot_with)
  - the warning at the top is about completely wiping system keys and it appears that sbctl re-installs those keys when done correctly (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Using_your_own_keys)
  - should be able to use with systemd-boot just fine (https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/xzr9ro/how_to_boot_with_secureboot_enabled_in_systemdboot/)
  - user reporting bricking on NVIDIA with secure boot was false alarm, just followed guide correctly and worked: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/pec41w/secure_boot_selfsigned_keys_nvidia_gpu_bricked/
  - random guide that seems to confirm general premise working by using the standard sbcli workflow: https://gist.github.com/Th3Whit3Wolf/0150bd13f4b2667437c55b71bfb073e4

** TODO handle warnings about =Possibly missing firmware=
You are basically guaranteed to get warnings of the general format:
#+begin_src
  => WARNING: Possibly missing firmware for module: '$MODULE_NAME'
#+end_src

Even funnier, you will get different warnings between the build for
the default (i.e. =initramfs-linux=, =initramfs-linux-lts=) image and the fallback versions.

For my machine, on a clean install, I got the following for the defaults:
- =xhci_pci=
- =qat_420xx=


For the fallback versions, I got the following:
- =xhci_pci=
- =aic94xx=
- =bfa=
- =qed=
- =qla1280=
- =qla2xxx=
- =wd719x=
- =qat_420xx=


Most of the time, this does not matter. Several of these modules are
for ancient hardware that is (mostly) irrelevant. Realistically, it
will never matter *unless* you find are going out of your way to play
with old hardware, etc.

This is especially true for the *fallback* version.

I would like to solve the warnings for the two that are thrown for the *non-fallback* images:
- for =xhci_pci=, there's an [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/upd72020x-fw][AUR package that can be installed]]
- for =qat_420xx=... there's no [[https://intel.github.io/quickassist/RN/In-Tree/in_tree_firmware_RN.html#qat-firmware-available][current release for linux]].
  - you will see that =qat_420xx.bin= and =qat_420xx_mmp.bin= are
    listed as =Pending= under version and release date.
  - previous iterations, e.g. =qat_4xxx=, have been merged into
    =linux-firmware= so there's a good chance this will be resolved
    over time.


for all the others generated by the fallback images, there are [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mkinitcpio#Possibly_missing_firmware_for_module_XXXX][existing packages to solve this]].
* liveUSB recovery commands
remember how I ssh into my machine? this is also useful for getting a
rescue environment up and going quickly if something goes wrong.
** boot the liveusb
ssh into the machine for ease of copy-pasting commands:
- =iwctl=
  - station list
  - station wlan0 connect SmallsShadowRealm-5
  - quit
- =passwd=
- =ip addr show= for ip addr

once ssh'd in:

** luks

decrypt luks partition

#+begin_src sh
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1p2 main
#+end_src

** mount

mount all relevant btrfs partitions. tbqf, swap and even the var
volumes are probably not strictly required but it doesn't hurt to
mount them when the goal is recovery.

#+begin_src sh
  mount -o subvol=@ /dev/mapper/main /mnt
  mount -o subvol=@log /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/log
  mount -o subvol=@pkg /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg
  mount -o subvol=@tmp /dev/mapper/main /mnt/var/tmp
  mount -o subvol=5 /dev/mapper/main /mnt/btrfs
  # idk if swap is actually needed but lol
  mount -o compress=no,subvol=@swap /dev/mapper/main /mnt/swap
  swapon /mnt/swap/swapfile
#+end_src

mount efi

#+begin_src sh
  mount -o uid=0,gid=0,fmask=0077,dmask=0077 /dev/nvmeon1p1 /mnt/boot
#+end_src

chroot

#+begin_src sh
  arch-chroot /mnt
#+end_src
